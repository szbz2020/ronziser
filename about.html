            <h1>About</h1>
            <div class="cv-sections" id="about"> 
                <p>Ron Ziser is a London-based visual artist with a background in Fine Art and Art History. After completing his undergraduate degree at Goldsmiths University, he spent several years running an architectural visualisation business and subsequently worked as a freelance graphic and web designer. During this time, he utilised open-access workshops to experiment with various CNC processes, which have become a prominent part of his practice.</p>
                
                <p>He later returned to academia, earning a postgraduate degree in Sculpture from the Royal College of Art and Design. His artistic practice is characterised by a unique blend of themes, materials, and techniques, driven by his diverse interests, including product design, computer engineering, and visual communication. These influences inform his multifaceted approach to art and the deeper themes within his work, allowing him to constantly evolve and adapt his creative processes.</p>
                
                <p>Amongst these themes is a special focus on the relationship between the physical and digital realms, which is reflected in his use of digital tools alongside traditional techniques, relating to a particular interest in artificial intelligence and virtual reality. His research into psychology and economics shapes his perspective on the societal context of his creations, while nature and architecture serve as constant sources of visual inspiration, influencing the organic forms and industrial motifs he often employs in his designs.</p>
                
                <p>Today, he continues to create art from his London studio while expanding into various design-led projects and initiatives. In 2023, he co-directed the launch of the Batsheva Art Prize in collaboration with The Lobby TLV, which was established in honour of his mother, Batsheva Ziser.</p>
