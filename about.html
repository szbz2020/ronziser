                <p>Ron Ziser is a London-born visual artist with a background in Fine Art and Art History. After completing his undergraduate degree at Goldsmiths University, he spent several years running an architecture visualization business and subsequently worked as a freelance graphic and web designer. During this time, he utilized open-access workshops to experiment with various CNC processes, which have become a prominent part of his practice.</p>
                
                <p>He later returned to academia, earning a postgraduate degree in Sculpture from the Royal College of Art. During this period, he exhibited in notable venues such as Kurt Schwitters' Merz Barn and Standpoint Gallery while being tutored by leading artists. His artistic practice is characterized by a unique blend of disciplines, materials, and techniques, driven by his diverse interests. These influences inform his multifaceted approach to art and the deeper themes within his work.</p>
                
                <p>Ron frequently incorporates digital tools alongside traditional techniques to explore the intersection between the physical and the virtual, reflecting a keen interest in artificial intelligence. His understanding of economics shapes his perspective on the broader societal context of his creations, while nature and architecture serve as constant sources of visual inspiration, influencing the organic forms and industrial materials he often employs in his artworks.</p>
                
                <p>Today, Ron continues to create works that reflect his varied interests and experiences, consistently reinventing his practice and pushing the boundaries of creative expression. Alongside his artistic endeavors, he is building on his experience in computer-aided design to explore a range of entrepreneurial projects in the tech sector.</p>
